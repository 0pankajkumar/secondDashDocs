1. **Why am I unable to login?**
    There are a few reasons for it.
    * You are not using a valid directi / flock / radix / codechef email id. 
    * Or try to login in Private or Incognito mode.
    * Or you are not supposed to be in there. Ask the TA team to add you as a member. We are still on invite only mode.


2. **Why is the web page not opening?**
    * The website is accessible only in Directi / Zeta intranet. That means you can open it only in plex (just like tp or tapestry for attendance). You may use VPN to view otherwise.
    * You might not be in proper network. The website is accesible only in respective company's WiFi network in plex. Eg. Connection with Flock WiFi will not allow you to access Zeta's TAT dashboard.
