Entry is made restricted. We use Google's sign-in authentication system so that we can use our existing Google IDs to login.

But not all Google users are entertained. Only emails with *directi*, *flock*, *radix* & *codechef* domains are allowed inside. Others will be shown the doors.

All the settings are done using *"becandid@directi.com"* and it can be changed by visiting [here](https://console.developers.google.com)
